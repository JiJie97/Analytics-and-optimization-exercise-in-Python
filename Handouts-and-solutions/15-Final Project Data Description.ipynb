    "Note that almost all numbers have been altered (sanitized) by FritoLay to protect company trade secrets. (This sanitation process might have created errors and inconsistencies in the data.) However, you can assume that the picture the data portray is reasonably accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2018 FLNA 10 RegionMap_DECEMBER.pptx**: a map of the 10 sales regions of FritoLays North America.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2018_P12_inventory_report.xlsx**: a report of the amount of inventory of each product in each warehouse in 2018 sales period 12.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **distribution_cost_cleaned.xlsx**: a report about the transportation cost for shipping each product between warehouses. Such shipping is needed because certain products are only made in certain warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **estimated_margins.csv**: estimates of the profit margins of FritoLays for various products. For legal reasons, these are not the true numbers, but are reasonable estimates.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **sales2018.csv.gz**: all sales of FritoLays products in 2018 in each sales period (each period is 4 weeks). This data records sales in each region to each retail chain. (Examples of retail chain include Ralphs, Seven Eleven, and Ranch 99.) Due to customer privacy, the identity of the chain is hidden and you only have a numerical ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales2018_products.csv.gz**: more detailed information about each product in the sales2018.csv.gz dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales2018_SOUTHWEST_deepdive.csv.gz**: more detailed sales data for the Southwest region (which includes Los Angeles). This shows data from each warehouse to each retail chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sales2018_SOUTHWEST_warehouses.csv.gz**: more detailed information about the warehouses in the above dataset.\n",
