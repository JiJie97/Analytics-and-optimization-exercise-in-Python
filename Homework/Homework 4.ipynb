    "## Instructions for typesetting math in Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to render mathematical expressions nicely in Markdown cells, using a type of script called \"LaTex\". LaTex the standard format for people in most technical fields to write math nicely. (You can Google for examples of what you can do with LaTex.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To render an expression using LaTex, the expression must be enclosed with dollar signs. For example, the expression `$X>0$` is rendered $X>0$. A single dollar sign is for mathematical expressions within the same line, and double dollar signs are for a standalone mathematical expressions in its own line. Hence, `$$X > 0.$$` is rendered as  $$X>0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of how to typeset various mathematical symbols using Latex (the math itself is not that meaningful, but I wanted to showcase all the commands you would need). For additional examples, see the course handouts (the .ipynb files from nbviewer), or Google for \"latex math examples.\"\n",
