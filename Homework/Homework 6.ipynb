Hence, to make it right aligned both before and after the colon, we use a double `&&` after the `\\text{}`. If this is confusing, you can simply copy this convention for this homework (`&&` after the explanation of constraint, and `&` before the sign). \n",

Hence, if there is any error at all, then the LaTex will not render and you will see your original script.** When this happens, try to render one line at a time and see which line is causing the error.

    "**(DMD Exercise 7.2)** The Magnetron Company manufactures and markets microwave ovens. Currently, the company produces two models: full-size and compact. Production is limited by the amount of labor available in the general assembly and electronic assembly departments, as well as by the demand for each model. Each full-size oven requires 2 hours of general assembly and 2 hours of electronic assembly, whereas each compact oven requires 1 hour of general assembly and 3 hours of electronic assembly. In the current production period, there are 500 hours of general assembly labor available and 800 hours of electronic assembly labor available. \n",

    "In additional, the company estimates that it can sell at most 220 full-size ovens and 180 compact ovens in the current production period. The earnings contribution per oven is 120 dollars for a full-size oven and 130 dollars for a compact oven. The company would like to find an earnings-maximizing production plan for the current production period. \n",

What is the difference in the optimal objective value? Divide this by 10 to find the marginal value of 1 unit of additional general assembly labor (which is the shadow price of this constraint). \n",
