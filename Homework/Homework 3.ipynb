    "## Q1. Optimal Stocking Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `optBaseStock` with four input arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `levelList`: a list of possible stocking levels to optimize over (which can be a `range` instead of a `list`).\n",
    "- `demandList`: a list of demand scenarios. \n",
    "- `underage`: the unit cost of having too little inventory to meet demand.\n",
    "- `overage`: the unit cost of having too much inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should iterate through the possible stocking levels in `levelList`, and print one line giving the average inventory cost for that stocking level. For a given stocking level, the average inventory cost is defined as the average over all demand scenarios of the total underage cost plus the total overage cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the stocking level is 10, and the demand scenarios are `[6,12,14]`, and the parameters `underage=9`, `overrage=5`. Then the inventory cost for the scenario `demand=6` is $(10-6)\\times 5=20$, because the inventory level is 4 units too high. (The overage cost of 5/unit is applied when inventory is too high). The inventory cost for the scenario `demand=12` is $(12-10)\\times 9=18$, because the inventory level is 2 units too low. (The underage cost of 9/unit is applied when the inventory is too low.) The inventory cost for the scenario `demand=14` is $(14-10)\\times 9=36$, because the inventory level is 4 units too low. The average inventory cost for stocking level 10 is $(20+18+36)/3=74/3\\approx 24.67$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return two objects. The first object is the stocking level that achieves the minimal average inventory cost (if there is a tie, return the smallest stocking level yielding the minimal cost). The second object is a dictionary mapping each inventory level to the average inventory cost for that stocking level. "
