    "In this exercise we examine the effects of overbooking in the airline industry. Ontario Gateway Airlines' first class cabins have 10 seats in each plane. Ontario's overbooking policy is to sell up to 11 first class tickets, since cancellations and no-shows are always possible (and indeed are quite likely). For a given flight on Ontario Gateway, there were 11 first class tickets sold. Suppose that each of the 11 persons who purchased tickets has a 20 percent chance of not showing up for the flight, and that the events that different persons show up for the flight are independent.\n",

Suppose further that any overbooked seat costs the airline 3,000 dollars, which is the cost of the free ticket issued the passenger plus some potential cost in damanged customer relations. (First class passengers do not expect to be bumped!) Thus, for example, if 10 of the first class passengers show up for the flight, the airline's profit is 12,000.

    "In this exercise, you will use the `scipy.stats` package and `np.random.choice` function to generate normal and general discrete samples, in order to plot the shape of the probability distributions of the daily earnings from using Rockport in the example in DMD 5.1 (from pre-class readings). Simulate 10000 samples and plot the frequency instead of the density. You should also include the proper titles and labels of the x and y axis. Write your code in the code cell below (a correct sample graph is below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "See page 196-197 in DMD for description of the distribution. It has the form $price*min(demand,3500)-10000$, where price is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = 3.65$ and standard deviation of $\\sigma=0.2$, demand follows a discrete distribution, as in the following table. You should make the price zero whenever you get a negative sample.\n",
